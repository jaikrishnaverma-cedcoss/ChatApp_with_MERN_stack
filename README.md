# Chat App using MERN Stack

This project is a full-stack chat application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to chat with friends individually or create groups for group chats. The application provides a seamless and real-time communication experience, with features including individual and group messaging, user authentication, and more.

## Features

- **Individual Chat**: Users can chat with friends individually by sending messages in real-time.
- **Group Chat**: Users can create groups and invite friends to join, enabling group messaging.
- **Real-Time Communication**: The application uses WebSocket technology for real-time messaging, ensuring instant delivery of messages.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring user privacy and data security.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing users to chat on any device.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing user data, chat messages, and group information.
- **Express.js**: Node.js web application framework used for building the backend API.
- **React.js**: Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface and components.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for running the server-side code.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication protocol used for enabling instant messaging.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication mechanism used for securing user authentication and authorization.
